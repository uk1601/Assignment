awk '{for (i=1;i<=NF;i++) if($(i)!=$(i+1)) printf("%s%s",$i,FS)}{printf("\n")}'


The above command is using the awk program to process input. Awk is a powerful command-line tool that can be used to perform operations on lines of text in a file or input.

The script starts with '{', which indicates the beginning of a block of code that will be executed for each line of input. Inside the block, there is a for loop that iterates over each field (delimited by FS, or field separator) of the input.

The loop starts with the variable i being set to 1, and continues as long as i is less than or equal to the number of fields (NF) in the current line. 
For each iteration of the loop, the script checks if the current field (denoted by $i) is not equal to the next field ($(i+1)).
If this condition is true, the script prints the current field followed by the field separator (FS) using the printf function.

After all fields have been processed, the script prints a new line using the printf("\n") function.

This script can be used to remove consecutive duplicates from input. The output will only contain a field if it is different from the previous one.
Note: This script assumes that input is properly formatted with a consistent field separator. It may not produce the desired output if this is not the case.
